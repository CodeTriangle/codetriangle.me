title: Contact CodeTriangle
---

I am a bit tricky to get ahold of
due to my refusal to use
traditional social media.
As soon as I get some mail self-hosted
for this domain,
that will be the preferred way to contact me.

Until then, feel free to reach out to me
in the following ways:

* Discord (@codetriangle â€” I accept DM requests),
* IRC (I'm Trigon on libera.chat),
* Matrix (I'm @codetriangle:matrix.org)
* Lame, non-self-hosted email
  (reuben dot staley at google's email service, you know the one).
