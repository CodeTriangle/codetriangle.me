Oh, you want to see some of the things I've made, huh?
Sounds kinda boring, but okay.

At the bottom of this page,
you will find a list of projects
sorted by publication date
(these dates are not representative
of when they were actually created;
instead, they reflect the time
I decided to write about them).
Alternatively, I will include
a curated list below.

## [SSH Cheatsheet](@/projects/2024-10-06.ssh-cheatsheet.md)

A useful reference
for the effective use
of the OpenSSH client.
Proven to be valuable
for newbies and veterans alike.

## [Mastermind](@/projects/2024-02-12.mastermind.md)
