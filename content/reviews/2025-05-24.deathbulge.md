I found this game on a whim one day.
It looked interesting enough
and the pitch really grabbed my attention
so I put it on my wishlist.
About a year later,
I finally bought the game while it was on sale.
I went in with no clear idea of what to expect.
What I found was **nothing less than a masterpiece**.

*Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands*
is a quirky turn-based JRPG
with a cartoony hand-drawn artstyle
and a unique sense of humor
where you control a cursed
three-piece rock band
who have the ability
to engage in musical battles
where they deal damage with their music.
And it rocks.

Of all the game genres out there,
it seems that the JRPG
is the subject of some of the most experimentation.
I think that in large part,
that's because the traditional turn-based JRPG
just has *a lot* of flaws.
People still make and play JRPGs,
but very few of them still have
all of the annoying elements
associated with the early days
of the genre.
Some measure of defiance, therefore,
is the norm
when creating in this space.
I also believe that,
due to the nature of the mechanics at play,
there are *so many* ways
to put your own personal spin
on the JRPG formula;
in this way, it is
a uniquely spinnable space
to create in.
Think of how *Earthbound* sets itself apart
from its contemporaries mechanically
versus how *Undertale* does
or how *Paper Mario* does.
I think what sets *Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands*
apart from its contemporaries
is that its creators came up with
ways to **break RPG conventions
that no one else even thought of breaking**.

To introduce this concept,
I'd like to start by discussing the battle system.
*Deathbulge* has a **turn-based battle system**
with a strong **active time element**
(think *Chrono Trigger*).
Your fronted character
moves across a bar
and when they reach the end,
they can perform a move.
The uniqueness comes from the fact
that the bar is subdivided into four "measures,"
each of which can hold some kind of effect
that is applied to the fronted player
while the marker is in that measure.

![Measure effects in Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands](/images/reviews/dbbotb/screenshot-1.png)

This bar replaces many elements
of the traditional turn-based battle system
including status effects, summons, and more
(which I will not spoil
because I think it is best
to experience what else the bar does
on your own).
In the image above,
the flaming skull effect
is called **PAIN**
and is a stand-in
for burn, poison,
and any other automatic
life-loss status effect.
You can also see **HASTE**,
which speeds your marker up
as it passes through those measures
and **MAD PAIN**
which is an upgraded form of Pain.
The purple one on the far right of the image
will remain a mystery.

This mechanic is **so cool**!
I've never truly engaged
with status effects that deeply before.
I think it's because,
although I do understand that they're there,
it's hard to visualize what tangible benefit
it gives me to inflict status effects on enemies,
especially the more complex ones.
This game really hit for me
because finally I have a way
to understand *what* effects do
and exactly how helpful they are.
It adds an additional strategic element.
Fundamentally, it is
a kind of **open-ended puzzle**
that you play alongside
the main combat system.
It additionally adds some more dynamicity
since things are happening all the time,
including between turns.

The litle carat in the image
indicates where the next effects
will be applied.
In this case,
if the player were to make a move
that applied two measures of an effect
to their own bar,
it would override the Haste,
not the Pain,
which would obviously be preferable.
After looking at some others' reviews,
I noticed some people say
that it's frustrating
that you can't choose
which measures to apply effects to.
I couldn't agree less!
Maneuvering around the temperamental bar
trying to override negative measure effects
and retain positive ones
is integral to the puzzle.
The most I would ask for
that I don't believe the game provisions
is a beat or move
that allows you to skip measures,
applying no effect to them,
but even that is not necessary
as there are ways later on in the game
that can provide a comparable effect
that provides more utility anyway.

The moment I realized
that I was truly in for something else entirely
was when I got a tutorial
on how to use items.
That's right, one element
where Deathbulge innovates
where I can't think of any other game
that does so
is in its **item system**.
I'd never thought of JRPG items
as something to be fixed.
In fact, I noticed while writing this paragraph
that the phrase "item system"
doesn't even sound like something that's real
because no one in the history of gaming
has ever said anything like
"that game has a really interesting item system."
Yet this dev team once again proved
that I am stupid for *not* talking
about item systems in games.

In *Deathbulge*, you have a limited quantity of "stock"
which can be redeemed in various quantities for "merch,"
which provide different item effects.
For instance, a low-potency restorative item costs 1 stock,
while a higher-potency restorative item costs 2,
and a group-healing item costs 3.

![An early-game merch menu in Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands](/images/reviews/dbbotb/merch.png)

This system innovates in a few interesting ways,
adding onto what is usually a pretty rote system
in most other games that have consumable items,
not even just JRPGs.
First, it adds **versatility**:
once you have a certain piece of merch unlocked,
you can use it in any battle,
so long as you are willing to pay its stock cost.
It also adds **balancing**:
there is an issue that occurs in many other RPGs
where lesser healing items lose all relevance
once you reach the endgame
and have enough money that
you can just purchase a full inventory
of better-quality items.
No, every item use is an intentional choice here
with its own considerations.

Finally, it does something truly grand:
it combats the ubiquitous analysis paralysis
among gamers that prevent us
from ever using our items.
There are no single-use merch items
and there are no ways that not using an item
in a particular fight would benefit you
in a fight further down the road.
The only thing it costs you
if you want to use an item
is money,
which is easily acquired.

A large part of this game
is dependent on **building your character**.
But, like, in a cool and innovative way.
Many games, including some that I quite like,
encourage you to pursue
a specialized build for your character,
but give you very little incentive to do so
as just randomly picking moves and stats
will get you to the end with no major hitches.
In *Deathbulge*,
this couldn't be further from the truth.
You have one "beat" slot that can be filled
from a shared pool of options,
three "mod" slots that contain moves
unique to your character,
and one (later two) "patch" slots
(again, pulling from a combined pool)
which provide passive benefits.
All told, that's not too much space to work with,
meaning that there is **no room for fluff**.
You have a lot of choices for each slot,
so find those synergies or die.
This is the first game that I've played
that has actually gotten me to spend time
theorycrafting potential combinations.

![An early-game view of the gear menu in Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands](/images/reviews/dbbotb/gear.png)

The one major thing in battles
that doesn't strictly adhere
to this philosophy
is items.
As mentioned previously,
you do have access
to a wide variety of merch items
by the end of the game,
which on paper seems like it could break
the careful balance of battles.
In practice, they do not
and probably cannot break the game
and in fact add even more interest
to the battle system.
Many of the good merch items
eat up sizeable chunks
of even the maximum final stock count.
In fact, stock is the only resource in a battle
that is *truly* limited
since Hype (this game's resource
that can be expended to perform moves,
like MP or SP in other games)
refills automatically
and health can be recovered.
Even new lives can be cheap
depending on your build and situation.
Every other advantage is gained
as you use your moves.
But if you want even *one* effect
that you didn't intentionally build for,
you can technically have it,
but that's coming out
of your only limited resource pool.
Tough luck.

At this point,
I'll take a bit of a **diversion**
to talk about my own build a bit
because it's illustrative
of one of my few problems with this game.
Feel free to skip this part.
Although I really loved
trying to come up with builds,
I stumbled onto something really effective
about halfway through the game
and as much as I wanted to experiment
with other kinds of builds,
it just kept working
and, in fact, the same build
just kept getting more effective
with the addition of more mods
that just made it even more effective.

<details>
<summary>
The core of the engine,
for those curious,
is as follows (contains spoilers):
</summary>

Make Faye a **Show-Off**
and give her heavy-hitting Melody moves
that apply effects to your own bar.
Make Ian a **Headbanger**
and give him heavy-hitting Noise moves
that apply effects to the opponent's bar.
Give Briff **restorative moves**
that apply Soothe and its variants
and, crucially, **Good Vibe Preservation**.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
To set up a tough fight:
</summary>

Start by filling your bar with effects,
Faye's speed from the show-off class
often lets you get one or more of these in
before the enemy gets one turn.
Then, have Briff use Good Vibe Preservation.
At this point, you will be shielded
from the brunt of many attacks
both in terms of hit points and measure effects.

Now, all members of the party
are able to use
whatever moves they want
without too much risk
as most enemies
are not equipped with moves
that can shred through
your now-protected measure effects.
I think I can count on one hand
the number of times
I came across an enemy that applies
more than two measure effects at once,
so in the course of normal battle
you should have plenty of warning
to run Good Vibe Preservation again.
Also, if you ever have a bad bar,
GVP can clear out the negative effects
and advance you to an unshielded effect
that you can safely write over
either with Faye or Briff.

Play cautiously,
don't let them touch your bar,
and if you ever lose a battle,
set up harder.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
At the end of the game, my loadout was:
</summary>

* **Faye**: Axe of Annihilation, Breezin', and Dazzling Shred.
* **Ian**: Zero Hertz, Mega Pop Slap, and Palm Destroyer.
* **Briff**: GONG, Weaver of Darkness, and Good Vibe Preservation.

After writing this section,
I actually discovered something interesting:
a lot of the gear that I was using
was actually buffed in the 1.1.0 update.
So, uh, mission accomplished
with those buffs I guess.

</details>

I liked my loadout, and I felt powerful while using it
(up until the final boss, which really tested me)
but it left most party members with their **default class**
and I still ended up using quite a few mods
that I got at the beginning of the game,
so while I was did swap some out,
it didn't feel like I was constantly innovating,
just switching to a better variant of the same strategy.
At one point I tried swapping some of my characters classes
while keeping the engine proper intact
to see if I could try something different,
but it just didn't feel effective
and it would have taken a lot of experimenting
to get it to work, I think.
Furthermore, I know there were inefficiencies
even in my final loadout.
Some moves were quite rarely used
and some mods even got in the way more than they helped.
But I never *had* to iron that out,
and it started to feel just a bit cheap
later on in the game.

<details>
<summary>
One slightly spoilery note
about balancing in the endgame:
</summary>

I did appreciate, though,
how the level counter is capped at 20.
At one point I was starting to get concerned
that I was going to find myself overleveled
and that I would end up
just ripping through the final boss
without feeling that I'd earned it.
But the level cap
is intelligently placed
such that for the final fights in the game,
you can't just level past them.
You have to get good enough
at the actual mechanics of the game
and create a good loadout
if you want to reach the end.

</details>

**Diversion over.**

Somehow I've gotten this far
without even mentioning the art in this game.
This game has a stupid amount of art and animation.
I swear, almost every cutscene in this game
has at least one character animation or dialogue portrait
that I had never seen before.
I was blown away
by just how expressive these characters are.
In battle, many moves have their own unique animations
that don't play anywhere else.
And, as mentioned, there is no shortage of moves.
Also, all of the main characters
have different class-based appearances
which affect their sprites
in the overworld and in battle
as well as in their numerous dialogue expressions.

And it's not just the characters.
Some of my favorite animations in this game
are in the combat elements.
The measure effects aren't static images.
They have detailed animations when they appear
and they move and sway in oddly satisfying ways
while they sit in the bar,
helping to provide a clear visual language
during the otherwise very stimulating battles.

The game's principle artist
is [Dan Martin](https://bsky.app/profile/deathbulge.bsky.social),
who runs a webcomic
(also called [*Deathbulge*](https://deathbulge.com)).
This comic originated
[several](https://deathbulge.com/comics/343)
[memes](https://deathbulge.com/comics/384)
that you've probably seen around.
He also apparently
created [this image](https://x.com/deathbulge/status/1075764020072697857)
if that is worth anything to you.
If you go back to the comic
after finishing the game
or if you were familiar with the comic
and played the game,
you would notice some shared characters
and even a few familiar bits.
By Dan's [own admission](https://deathbulge.com/comics/435),
he spent every day
for most of a decade
working on the game.
I am no artist,
but I can recognize effort
when I see it.
The game is a cartoony visual feast,
manic and exaggerated
in just the right way
to complement the game's
off-the-wall sense of humor.
This game wouldn't have hit *nearly* the same
if there hadn't been such a clear emphasis
on the aesthetic
(although if there were even half as many
unique dialogue portraits in this game,
it would have still been more expressive
than even most other story-based games
that I have played in the past).

That all being said,
I just didn't really vibe with the story,
at least at the start.
Like many video game stories,
things start lower-stakes
and gradually the intensity ramps up.
I was frustrated by the fact
that the first few chapters
were completely unrelated
to the Battle of the Bands.
Even though plot elements from them
do come back later
and are instrumental in wrapping up the game,
they felt so irrelevant at the time
and I still don't think
that it was that great of a start
to the game.
I'm glad that the gameplay,
the humor,
the characters,
and the worldbuilding
kept me going until the story
really started to pick up.

I also had high expectations for the
[soundtrack](https://deathbulge.bandcamp.com/album/deathbulge-battle-of-the-bands-ost),
given the entire theming of the game
and whoops, we hit peak again.
There's over two hours of music in this game
created by the two composers,
[Leslie Wai](https://twitter.com/lesliewai)
and [Patrick Henaghen](http://discobible.com/).
There is no lack of variety here.
A large amount of the music in this game
is instrumental rock,
given that that is the style
that the main characters play.
But certain other bands
introduce different genres
including heavy metal, synth pop,
jazz fusion, smooth jazz,
and a lot of funk.
I urge you to give it a listen.
There's a lot to keep you occupied.
And a lot of these songs
are rather substantial.
I'm used to fairly short loops
in video game music
but the composers for this game
have given us a bunch of
multiple-minute tracks
that make even walking around in the world
feel interesting.

And while I'm individually thanking
every member of the team,
I might as well get everyone.
[Kyle Jenkins](https://twitter.com/diviocy)
and [Scott Walenty](https://twitter.com/raidenthequick)
of [Five Houses Games](https://www.fivehousesgames.com/index.html),
handled the technical aspects
of game development
for *Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands*.
This game is extremely smooth
and polished to a sheen
to the point of being almost frictionless
and that would not have been possible
without the diligent work
of these two members of the team.
Also, I need to show this
because it is genuinely one of the coolest things
that a game developer has ever done.
Dan actually [drew some fanart](https://bsky.app/profile/deathbulge.bsky.social/post/3lgvv25ss222a)
of the code of this game
to thank the team for their work.

My save file,
which finished up at 75% completion,
is at 15 hours,
give or take.
I would say that 100% completion
would probably take
about 20 hours.
By that metric,
this is a compact game,
by JRPG standards at least.
I think in some ways
the length is actually ideal.
The game does a good job
of not overstaying its welcome.
If the game were *too* much longer,
it would probably start
to feel repetitious
and its humor might start to grate,
so I'm glad that the devs
decided to cap it off here.
At the same time,
a part of me is screaming
that I just want to play eight more chapters
of the same exact same game.

*Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands*
has no right being as obscure as it is.
Only 500 reviews? Are you kidding me?
This game is an innovative modern classic
and should be recognized as such.
I want to see swaths of games come out
that are inspired by this one
if only because
I need more of this game.
There is replay value here.
I would like to return to this game
in a year or so
and force myself to enjoy
some alternative strategies.

This game gets a **hearty recommendation**.
I think more people should be aware of it,
which is why I'm in the process of telling
all of my friends to play it.
If even one part of this appeals to you,
I'd encourage you to give it a try
as even one
of the previously discussed talking points
would be enough to merit a purchase,
especially if it's on sale.
To wrap up, though,
I would just like to mention that,
while I loved the fact
that every part of the game
from the combat to items to teambuilding
was all a fun open-ended puzzle,
that might not vibe with you.
Maybe skip this one
if you want an RPG
where you can just blast through enemies.
But if that particular descriptor
does not apply to you,
there's no reason not to give this one a try.

[steam review of this game](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199158155458/recommended/1083790))*
