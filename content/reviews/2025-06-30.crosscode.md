A few years ago,
before I really started using Steam,
I had a habit of scrolling for hours
through games on the Nintendo Switch Eshop
on the "Great Deals" page,
sometimes even reaching
the end of the list.
It was from this page
that I was able to harvest
some of my most niche indie picks.
Multiple times throughout this process
I passed over a game called *CrossCode*,
which I would always look over
but never purchase.
I was more risk-averse in those days.
Today, if I see a game with a page
half as promising as *CrossCode*'s
and it costs just $10,
I will often just buy it on sight.
But because I never did,
that the existence of *CrossCode*
was a fairly constant presence
somewhere in the back of my mind.
Then in 2022, itch.io offered
the [Bundle for Ukraine](https://itch.io/b/1316/bundle-for-ukraine),
and I finally ran out of excuses
not to play *CrossCode*.

![The title screen of *CrossCode*](/images/reviews/crosscode/title.png)

So, over the course of about a week,
mostly during very late nights
in my college dorm
in spring of 2022,
I binged the entire game.
My opinions on the game
are most poignantly expressed
by example.
After I finished the game,
I bought it on Steam
at full price
just to support the developers,
along with the DLC.
I also purchased the game
four or five times
to give as Christmas gifts to my friends,
prompting several of them
to individually purchase the DLC themselves.

In other words, it's **extremely good**.
*CrossCode* is one of my easiest recommendations
to just about anyone,
familiar with the genre or not.
Get ready for me to say this exact thing,
rephrased in different contexts,
dozens of times in this review.

To start off this review,
I want to make a point to acknowledge
the most novel aspect of *CrossCode*,
the one aspect of the game
that I have never seen done
by any other game.
This is technically a spoiler,
but you will learn it
45 minutes into the game
before even entering the tutorial dungeon.
*CrossCode* employs a unique
**embedded narrative**.
*CrossCode* is set almost entirely
inside of the fictional MMORPG *CrossWorlds*.
This has massive consequences
for basically every aspect of the game.
Characterization,
plot points, worldbuilding,
game mechanics, world design.
All of these elements
require multiple levels of analysis:
one for *CrossCode* and one for *CrossWorlds*.

As an example, while playing *CrossCode*,
you experience
most of the plot of *CrossWorlds*;
however, the plot of these games
are not the same, not nearly.
*CrossWorlds* has a fairly standard plot
for an action game,
with the traditional concessions
required for the plot to make sense
in the context of an MMORPG.
It mostly tries
to get out of the players' way,
introducing the lore of the world
and providing the environments,
which allows players to create
their own personalized adventure
within the confines of the game world.
*CrossCode*'s plot, on the other hand,
is a much more thematically rich narrative
about a group of players
who join up to play *CrossWorlds*
and form a gripping friendship
in the process.

The developers of *CrossCode*
are keenly aware of the gap here,
with much of the writing
poking gentle fun at this fact,
allowing the developers
to lightheartedly criticize certain RPG tropes
while sincerely indulging in others
in a very believable fashion.
For example, since some characters in *CrossCode*
are real people who exist
outside of *CrossWorlds*,
there are a few pretty good jokes
about the way that they
(as real people)
are so much more sophisticated
than *CrossWorlds*' NPCs,
despite all of them
being NPCs within the context
of *CrossCode*.

![Multiple "players" interacting in CrossWorlds](/images/reviews/crosscode/npc-players.png)

I would say that,
simply for this aspect of its writing,
*CrossCode* is one of the most fascinating games
to analyze as a work of art.
And, because of this choice,
*CrossCode* is able to
craft a truly unique narrative
about friendship, forgiveness,
love, and loss.

But, I don't want to spoil anything.
To experience this game
knowing too much about where it goes
would be nothing less than a tragedy.
If this last section
piqued your interest enough,
you might even consider clicking off here
and just playing the game yourself.

But, you might still want to stay
and learn a bit more
about the rest of the game.

Okay, so what kind of game
is *CrossCode*, actually?
Well, it's a **16-bit, top-down Action RPG**.
The stylistic inspirations
from the *Zelda* series
are extremely obvious
in the best way possible.
The dungeons and world maps in *CrossCode*
are a true love letter
to all the best elements
of design in the *Zelda* series.
They serve up all the complexity
of the sprawling designs
that characterize the top-down games
with all the spectacle
and cinematic appeal
that give richness to the 3D games.

![A puzzle in *CrossCode*](/images/reviews/crosscode/sliding-puzzle.png)

The puzzles in particular
feel like a fairly sizeable step up
from many *Zelda* puzzles.
The puzzle elements on display in *CrossCode*,
especially those in the later dungeons,
are both more interesting
and more reactive to stimula
than those in most *Zelda* games;
plus, each dungeon
has more and harder puzzles
than the average *Zelda* dungeon.

The most notable addition, though,
has got to be how much more
of an active role
the player has to take
to complete the puzzles.
In most dungeon crawlers,
just knowing how to get
the puzzle elements
into the right place
is 90% of the effort.
In *CrossCode*,
this number lowers to about 50%
for many puzzles.
Oftentimes, you are required
to move the puzzle elements
into their correct places,
then initiate the puzzle,
then make adjustments
to the puzzle elements on a timer
while the puzzle is completing.
I have taken to calling these
**execution-based puzzles**.
I absolutely adore them,
but I have heard mixed reviews
from a lot of other players.
There is an assist mode,
which can turn down the speed
of these execution-based puzzles,
but there are some who opine
that even their inclusion
hampers their enjoyment of the game.

*CrossCode* also differs from *Zelda*
in that there are not *Zelda*-style items
in the traditional sense.
In each dungeon,
you receive an element,
which acts as a modifier to your weapons.
These serve a combat purpose
as well as a puzzle-solving purpose,
which is neat,
but because each element
is used in exactly the same way
as the other elements,
some of the enjoyable parts
of *Zelda*-style puzzle solving
where you have to find out
how each item individually works
are heavily diminished.
This is not a dealbreaker,
not nearly.
But I do find myself missing it.

![Lea leveling up](/images/reviews/crosscode/level.png)

This is not to say
that *CrossCode* is
a *Zelda* clone
that just innovates
on certain *Zelda*-like aspects
of its formula.
To take just one example,
there are many more
**traditional RPG elements** present in *CrossCode*
than in any *Zelda* game.
*CrossWorlds* is an MMORPG, after all.
You gain experience which gives you levels
that can be used to unlock abilities
on a skill tree.
There's party management
and a quest log full of things to do.
These additions carry the benefits and flaws
that they have
in every other game,
and, admittedly, their integration
into the gameplay loop
is not all that inspired.
However, they serve their purpose.
Not every game *needs*
to innovate on everything
that makes RPGs unique
([though that can be fun](@/reviews/2025-05-24.deathbulge.md)).

![The circuit point skill tree](/images/reviews/crosscode/circuit.png)

Another way that *CrossCode*
sets itself apart from its inspirations
is in the combat system,
which is primarily based in the tradition
of twin-stick shooters.
Take aim at enemies from far away
or slash them at close range.
Switch between the four different elements,
which are, of course,
Heat, Cold, Shock, and Wave.

The addition of **elemental combat**
introduces a swath of interesting mechanics
that serve to make combat extremely dynamic.
Each element
has its own skill tree
containing three levels
of unlockable special moves.
Neutral (the lack of any element)
also has a skill tree
but with only two levels of moves.
Also, all of your stats go up
when switching out of neutral.
So you'll want to spend
as much time as possible
in one of the elemental modes.
However, it is a balancing act
because attacking in an elemental mode
builds up an "elemental overload" charge,
which forces you into neutral
if it overflows.
This charge dissipates over time
so long as you don't attack,
but it discharges faster in neutral mode.

![An enemy attacking with the Cold element](/images/reviews/crosscode/ice-punch.gif)

Elements come in pairs.
Heat opposes Cold and Shock opposes Wave
and vice-versa.
You'll land the most damage
against a Cold-type enemy
using Heat-based attacks,
but you'll also receive more damage yourself
if they manage to hit you.
If, however, you switch to heat
during a window
where the enemy has the advantage,
you'll take much less damage from their attacks.
Then, when they are more vulnerable,
you can swap to Cold to deal damage.
Interactions like this
are what make *CrossCode* combat
so interesting compared to many other games.
However, I'll leave most
of the intricacies of combat
for you to discover on your own,
dear reader.

![A powerful heat-type attack](/images/reviews/crosscode/heat-attack.gif)

But before moving on,
I would like to make one final note
about the combat system.
In my first playthrough of *CrossCode*,
I never had to intentionally grind
up to the level required to beat a boss,
though there are some situations
where I had to grind
to get trading materials
for the sake of a questline.
*CrossCode* has one of the most effective solutions
to the problem of tedious grinding
that I have ever seen,
in the form of **combat ranks**.
When you begin fighting an enemy,
you enter combat rank D
and defeating more enemies increases your rank.
After all the enemies
that you have been fighting
are defeated,
there is a short timer
during which you must find
more enemies to defeat
lest you lose your combat rank.

This is undeniably fun
and it gives you a reason
to push your luck during combat.
Some drops don't appear
unless you are higher than a certain rank,
and your chances of getting high-quality drops
increases as your rank does,
potentially shortening grinding times further,
rewarding skilled play.
Plus, if you *are* able to last long enough,
you achieve the fabled **S Rank**
and are treated to
one of the most hype songs
in the game
and double drop rates.

Any discussion of *CrossCode*
is incomplete without a mention
of its **soundtrack**.
[Nagi Shirakumo (née Deniz Akbulut)](https://shirakumon.com/)
should be on your list
of game composers to watch.
Every track in this game hits powerfully
with its accompanying scene
and the inspirations are as varied
as the game's environments,
although the jazz fusion-inspired tracks
have to be my favorite.
The loud, exciting, synthy battle themes
are some of the most instantly memorable songs
in video game history,
propelling you to keep the combat going
(if nothing else just so that you can hear
the incredible S-rank theme).
Then, when you do fall out of combat,
you're treated to the atmospheric area themes,
which range from pleasant to intriguing
to downright oppressive in places.
The final boss theme is
a glorious five-minute composition
featuring repeated time signature changes
and it is one of
the most complex pieces of music
I've listened to in a video game.

Now, I would not say
that I am in love with
the visual style of *CrossCode*.
However, I find
this particular type of 16-bit artstyle,
pseudo-SNES but souped up,
not entirely respecting pixel boundaries,
to be oversaturated.
In fact, the artstyle largely being nothing new
is one of the reasons I did not buy this game
back when I discovered it
on the Switch eShop.
Don't get me wrong,
it looks great when in motion,
oftentimes stunning,
and the animation work is top-notch.
I'd say it is a stellar execution
of a style that I've already seen
quite a few times.

But, on the less nitpicky side,
the artstyle is also is to blame
for possibly the biggest issue in the game:
**depth perception**.
CrossCode runs in a 3D physics engine,
but all rendering is done in 2D.
This can make it difficult to navigate
the highly vertical maps,
which can consist of up to three layers.
It is common that two cliffs
appear to be at the same height
on a cursory glance,
but are actually
an entire level apart from each other.
And the game does expect you
to make these jumps between cliffs.
Fortunately,
most sections where this is an issue
are entirely optional,
only leading to chests that contain consumables
or trading items,
but I can imagine this being
especially onerous for a completionist type.

![One of the more self-explanitory screens](/images/reviews/crosscode/jump.png)

*CrossCode* is **well worth** the $20 price tag,
but it does go on sale pretty frequently
(basically at every major Steam sale).
At any discounted price,
*CrossCode* is an honest **no-brainer**.

But there's also one major
paid content expansion:
the *A New Home* DLC,
which functions as a short sequel story,
providing some much-appreciated closure
on a lot of the elements of the main game
that may not have gotten
the sendoff that they deserved.
This DLC, however, is a bit of a mixed bag
among even fans of the game.

![The Ku'lero Temple](/images/reviews/crosscode/kulero.png)

The DLC dungeon
and the boss fight at the end
are unambiguously the best
by a fair margin.
It simply blows everything else
out of the water.
I have a hard time imagining a world
where almost any other game developer
makes anything even approaching
the multiple-hour behemoth
of puzzle solving and combat encounters
capped off with an incredibly tough
but rewarding boss fight
that is Ku'lero Temple.
The musical themes for the DLC area,
dungeon, and boss
are not by Deniz Akbulut,
but they are also top-tier songs,
and a good reason
why [はがね/Steel Plus](https://steelplus.xyz/)
should also be on
your list of game composers to watch.

The enemies in the DLC
are mostly reskins of old enemies,
with only a few exceptions,
and the new overworld area
is somewhat small in comparison
to the others.
Some players did not like
the *actual, final conclusion* of the game,
which occurs in the final chapter
after the DLC dungeon is completed.
I thought the boss fight in this area
was middling,
but I liked the story developments
that it enabled,
and I thought it provided
a compelling explanation
for one element
that I wanted answers on.

The DLC is perhaps **a bit steep**
at its standard retail price of $7,
depending on how much you enjoyed the base game,
but it also goes on sale quite often
and it, too, becomes **well worth it**
at its discounted price point.

But this is not the end of the review.
Radical Fish Games
is currently working on
their second ARPG,
similar to *CrossCode* in many ways
but also excitingly unique and fresh,
in the form of **[*Alabaster Dawn*](https://www.alabaster-dawn.com/)**
and it is currently
one of my **most anticipated games of all time**.
It seems to fix basically everything
that I found myself frustrated by
in *CrossCode*.
Its hybrid 3D artstyle
should render
depth-perception issues
a thing of the past.
Deep elemental combat returns
but with varied weapons
which have already proven
to have unique functions
in puzzle solving.
And the developers have promised
that the puzzle solving
will pull back on some
of the more controversial decisions
that made them divisive
without sacrificing any complexity.
Pull up a chair
and read the [development blog posts](https://www.radicalfishgames.com/?cat=17).
I hope you find them
just as exciting as I do.

![A preview of Alabaster Dawn](/images/reviews/crosscode/combat.png)

*CrossCode* might never be recognized
alongside *Hollow Knight* or *Celeste*
as a big dog of indie gaming
like I think it should,
but if we get enough attention
on *Alabaster Dawn*,
it just might have a shot.
So there's your call to action.
Buy *CrossCode*
and wishlist *Alabaster Dawn*.
