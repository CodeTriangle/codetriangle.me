Hello and welcome
to my video game review column.
While this website began
with a [tech blog](@/blog/_index.md)
and later expanded
into a kind of expanded resume
with the [projects section](@/projects/_index.md),
I found myself more and more interested
in discusing a wider variety of topics,
some not necessarily technical in nature.

As a compulsive critic
who plays a lot of games
and has a passion for explaining himself
in a long-winded way,
I realized that longer-form game reviews
actually sounded very fun to write.
And, despite what I say on my [home page](@/_index.md),
I don't actually *want*
to confuse and disorient people
who just want one type
of content from this site,
so I'm splitting this off
into its own section.

On this site,
I hope to document my thoughts
mostly on extremely high-quality indie games
that I feel have been overlooked.
I do not expect to gain
any substantial amount of popularity
from this venture,
but I do think that I will have fun writing it.
