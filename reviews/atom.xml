&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago,
before I really started using Steam,
I had a habit of scrolling for hours
through games on the Nintendo Switch Eshop
on the &quot;Great Deals&quot; page,
sometimes even reaching
the end of the list.
It was from this page
that I was able to harvest
some of my most niche indie picks.
Multiple times throughout this process
I passed over a game called &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
which I would always look over
but never purchase.
I was more risk-averse in those days.
Today, if I see a game with a page
half as promising as &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s
and it costs just $10,
I will often just buy it on sight.
But because I never did,
that the existence of &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
was a fairly constant presence
somewhere in the back of my mind.
Then in 2022, itch.io offered
the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itch.io&#x2F;b&#x2F;1316&#x2F;bundle-for-ukraine&quot;&gt;Bundle for Ukraine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
and I finally ran out of excuses
not to play &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;crosscode&#x2F;title.png&quot; alt=&quot;The title screen of CrossCode&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, over the course of about a week,
mostly during very late nights
in my college dorm
in spring of 2022,
I binged the entire game.
My opinions on the game
are most poignantly expressed
by example.
After I finished the game,
I bought it on Steam
at full price
just to support the developers,
along with the DLC.
I also purchased the game
four or five times
to give as Christmas gifts to my friends,
prompting several of them
to individually purchase the DLC themselves.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;extremely good&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
&lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is one of my easiest recommendations
to just about anyone,
familiar with the genre or not.
Get ready for me to say this exact thing,
rephrased in different contexts,
dozens of times in this review.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off this review,
I want to make a point to acknowledge
the most novel aspect of &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
the one aspect of the game
that I have never seen done
by any other game.
This is technically a spoiler,
but you will learn it
45 minutes into the game
before even entering the tutorial dungeon.
&lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; employs a unique
&lt;strong&gt;embedded narrative&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
&lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is set almost entirely
inside of the fictional MMORPG &lt;em&gt;CrossWorlds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
This has massive consequences
for basically every aspect of the game.
Characterization,
plot points, worldbuilding,
game mechanics, world design.
All of these elements
require multiple levels of analysis:
one for &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and one for &lt;em&gt;CrossWorlds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, while playing &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
you experience
most of the plot of &lt;em&gt;CrossWorlds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;;
however, the plot of these games
are not the same, not nearly.
&lt;em&gt;CrossWorlds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has a fairly standard plot
for an action game,
with the traditional concessions
required for the plot to make sense
in the context of an MMORPG.
It mostly tries
to get out of the players&#x27; way,
introducing the lore of the world
and providing the environments,
which allows players to create
their own personalized adventure
within the confines of the game world.
&lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s plot, on the other hand,
is a much more thematically rich narrative
about a group of players
who join up to play &lt;em&gt;CrossWorlds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
and form a gripping friendship
in the process.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developers of &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
are keenly aware of the gap here,
with much of the writing
poking gentle fun at this fact,
allowing the developers
to lightheartedly criticize certain RPG tropes
while sincerely indulging in others
in a very believable fashion.
For example, since some characters in &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
are real people who exist
outside of &lt;em&gt;CrossWorlds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
there are a few pretty good jokes
about the way that they
(as real people)
are so much more sophisticated
than &lt;em&gt;CrossWorlds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27; NPCs,
despite all of them
being NPCs within the context
of &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;crosscode&#x2F;npc-players.png&quot; alt=&quot;Multiple &amp;quot;players&amp;quot; interacting in CrossWorlds&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say that,
simply for this aspect of its writing,
&lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is one of the most fascinating games
to analyze as a work of art.
And, because of this choice,
&lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is able to
craft a truly unique narrative
about friendship, forgiveness,
love, and loss.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I don&#x27;t want to spoil anything.
To experience this game
knowing too much about where it goes
would be nothing less than a tragedy.
If this last section
piqued your interest enough,
you might even consider clicking off here
and just playing the game yourself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, you might still want to stay
and learn a bit more
about the rest of the game.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so what kind of game
is &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, actually?
Well, it&#x27;s a &lt;strong&gt;16-bit, top-down Action RPG&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
The stylistic inspirations
from the &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; series
are extremely obvious
in the best way possible.
The dungeons and world maps in &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
are a true love letter
to all the best elements
of design in the &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; series.
They serve up all the complexity
of the sprawling designs
that characterize the top-down games
with all the spectacle
and cinematic appeal
that give richness to the 3D games.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;crosscode&#x2F;sliding-puzzle.png&quot; alt=&quot;A puzzle in CrossCode&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The puzzles in particular
feel like a fairly sizeable step up
from many &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; puzzles.
The puzzle elements on display in &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
especially those in the later dungeons,
are both more interesting
and more reactive to stimula
than those in most &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; games;
plus, each dungeon
has more and harder puzzles
than the average &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; dungeon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most notable addition, though,
has got to be how much more
of an active role
the player has to take
to complete the puzzles.
In most dungeon crawlers,
just knowing how to get
the puzzle elements
into the right place
is 90% of the effort.
In &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
this number lowers to about 50%
for many puzzles.
Oftentimes, you are required
to move the puzzle elements
into their correct places,
then initiate the puzzle,
then make adjustments
to the puzzle elements on a timer
while the puzzle is completing.
I have taken to calling these
&lt;strong&gt;execution-based puzzles&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
I absolutely adore them,
but I have heard mixed reviews
from a lot of other players.
There is an assist mode,
which can turn down the speed
of these execution-based puzzles,
but there are some who opine
that even their inclusion
hampers their enjoyment of the game.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; also differs from &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
in that there are not &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;-style items
in the traditional sense.
In each dungeon,
you receive an element,
which acts as a modifier to your weapons.
These serve a combat purpose
as well as a puzzle-solving purpose,
which is neat,
but because each element
is used in exactly the same way
as the other elements,
some of the enjoyable parts
of &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;-style puzzle solving
where you have to find out
how each item individually works
are heavily diminished.
This is not a dealbreaker,
not nearly.
But I do find myself missing it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;crosscode&#x2F;level.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lea leveling up&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say
that &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is
a &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; clone
that just innovates
on certain &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;-like aspects
of its formula.
To take just one example,
there are many more
&lt;strong&gt;traditional RPG elements&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; present in &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
than in any &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; game.
&lt;em&gt;CrossWorlds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is an MMORPG, after all.
You gain experience which gives you levels
that can be used to unlock abilities
on a skill tree.
There&#x27;s party management
and a quest log full of things to do.
These additions carry the benefits and flaws
that they have
in every other game,
and, admittedly, their integration
into the gameplay loop
is not all that inspired.
However, they serve their purpose.
Not every game &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
to innovate on everything
that makes RPGs unique
(&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codetriangle.me&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;2025-05-24-deathbulge&#x2F;&quot;&gt;though that can be fun&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;crosscode&#x2F;circuit.png&quot; alt=&quot;The circuit point skill tree&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way that &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
sets itself apart from its inspirations
is in the combat system,
which is primarily based in the tradition
of twin-stick shooters.
Take aim at enemies from far away
or slash them at close range.
Switch between the four different elements,
which are, of course,
Heat, Cold, Shock, and Wave.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addition of &lt;strong&gt;elemental combat&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
introduces a swath of interesting mechanics
that serve to make combat extremely dynamic.
Each element
has its own skill tree
containing three levels
of unlockable special moves.
Neutral (the lack of any element)
also has a skill tree
but with only two levels of moves.
Also, all of your stats go up
when switching out of neutral.
So you&#x27;ll want to spend
as much time as possible
in one of the elemental modes.
However, it is a balancing act
because attacking in an elemental mode
builds up an &quot;elemental overload&quot; charge,
which forces you into neutral
if it overflows.
This charge dissipates over time
so long as you don&#x27;t attack,
but it discharges faster in neutral mode.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;crosscode&#x2F;ice-punch.gif&quot; alt=&quot;An enemy attacking with the Cold element&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elements come in pairs.
Heat opposes Cold and Shock opposes Wave
and vice-versa.
You&#x27;ll land the most damage
against a Cold-type enemy
using Heat-based attacks,
but you&#x27;ll also receive more damage yourself
if they manage to hit you.
If, however, you switch to heat
during a window
where the enemy has the advantage,
you&#x27;ll take much less damage from their attacks.
Then, when they are more vulnerable,
you can swap to Cold to deal damage.
Interactions like this
are what make &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; combat
so interesting compared to many other games.
However, I&#x27;ll leave most
of the intricacies of combat
for you to discover on your own,
dear reader.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;crosscode&#x2F;heat-attack.gif&quot; alt=&quot;A powerful heat-type attack&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before moving on,
I would like to make one final note
about the combat system.
In my first playthrough of &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
I never had to intentionally grind
up to the level required to beat a boss,
though there are some situations
where I had to grind
to get trading materials
for the sake of a questline.
&lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has one of the most effective solutions
to the problem of tedious grinding
that I have ever seen,
in the form of &lt;strong&gt;combat ranks&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
When you begin fighting an enemy,
you enter combat rank D
and defeating more enemies increases your rank.
After all the enemies
that you have been fighting
are defeated,
there is a short timer
during which you must find
more enemies to defeat
lest you lose your combat rank.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is undeniably fun
and it gives you a reason
to push your luck during combat.
Some drops don&#x27;t appear
unless you are higher than a certain rank,
and your chances of getting high-quality drops
increases as your rank does,
potentially shortening grinding times further,
rewarding skilled play.
Plus, if you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; able to last long enough,
you achieve the fabled &lt;strong&gt;S Rank&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
and are treated to
one of the most hype songs
in the game
and double drop rates.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any discussion of &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
is incomplete without a mention
of its &lt;strong&gt;soundtrack&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shirakumon.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Nagi Shirakumo (née Deniz Akbulut)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
should be on your list
of game composers to watch.
Every track in this game hits powerfully
with its accompanying scene
and the inspirations are as varied
as the game&#x27;s environments,
although the jazz fusion-inspired tracks
have to be my favorite.
The loud, exciting, synthy battle themes
are some of the most instantly memorable songs
in video game history,
propelling you to keep the combat going
(if nothing else just so that you can hear
the incredible S-rank theme).
Then, when you do fall out of combat,
you&#x27;re treated to the atmospheric area themes,
which range from pleasant to intriguing
to downright oppressive in places.
The final boss theme is
a glorious five-minute composition
featuring repeated time signature changes
and it is one of
the most complex pieces of music
I&#x27;ve listened to in a video game.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I would not say
that I am in love with
the visual style of &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
However, I find
this particular type of 16-bit artstyle,
pseudo-SNES but souped up,
not entirely respecting pixel boundaries,
to be oversaturated.
In fact, the artstyle largely being nothing new
is one of the reasons I did not buy this game
back when I discovered it
on the Switch eShop.
Don&#x27;t get me wrong,
it looks great when in motion,
oftentimes stunning,
and the animation work is top-notch.
I&#x27;d say it is a stellar execution
of a style that I&#x27;ve already seen
quite a few times.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, on the less nitpicky side,
the artstyle is also is to blame
for possibly the biggest issue in the game:
&lt;strong&gt;depth perception&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
CrossCode runs in a 3D physics engine,
but all rendering is done in 2D.
This can make it difficult to navigate
the highly vertical maps,
which can consist of up to three layers.
It is common that two cliffs
appear to be at the same height
on a cursory glance,
but are actually
an entire level apart from each other.
And the game does expect you
to make these jumps between cliffs.
Fortunately,
most sections where this is an issue
are entirely optional,
only leading to chests that contain consumables
or trading items,
but I can imagine this being
especially onerous for a completionist type.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;crosscode&#x2F;jump.png&quot; alt=&quot;One of the more self-explanitory screens&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;well worth&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; the $20 price tag,
but it does go on sale pretty frequently
(basically at every major Steam sale).
At any discounted price,
&lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is an honest &lt;strong&gt;no-brainer&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&#x27;s also one major
paid content expansion:
the &lt;em&gt;A New Home&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; DLC,
which functions as a short sequel story,
providing some much-appreciated closure
on a lot of the elements of the main game
that may not have gotten
the sendoff that they deserved.
This DLC, however, is a bit of a mixed bag
among even fans of the game.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;crosscode&#x2F;kulero.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Ku&amp;#39;lero Temple&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DLC dungeon
and the boss fight at the end
are unambiguously the best
by a fair margin.
It simply blows everything else
out of the water.
I have a hard time imagining a world
where almost any other game developer
makes anything even approaching
the multiple-hour behemoth
of puzzle solving and combat encounters
capped off with an incredibly tough
but rewarding boss fight
that is Ku&#x27;lero Temple.
The musical themes for the DLC area,
dungeon, and boss
are not by Deniz Akbulut,
but they are also top-tier songs,
and a good reason
why &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steelplus.xyz&#x2F;&quot;&gt;はがね&#x2F;Steel Plus&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
should also be on
your list of game composers to watch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enemies in the DLC
are mostly reskins of old enemies,
with only a few exceptions,
and the new overworld area
is somewhat small in comparison
to the others.
Some players did not like
the &lt;em&gt;actual, final conclusion&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of the game,
which occurs in the final chapter
after the DLC dungeon is completed.
I thought the boss fight in this area
was middling,
but I liked the story developments
that it enabled,
and I thought it provided
a compelling explanation
for one element
that I wanted answers on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DLC is perhaps &lt;strong&gt;a bit steep&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
at its standard retail price of $7,
depending on how much you enjoyed the base game,
but it also goes on sale quite often
and it, too, becomes &lt;strong&gt;well worth it&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
at its discounted price point.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not the end of the review.
Radical Fish Games
is currently working on
their second ARPG,
similar to &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in many ways
but also excitingly unique and fresh,
in the form of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alabaster-dawn.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alabaster Dawn&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
and it is currently
one of my &lt;strong&gt;most anticipated games of all time&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
It seems to fix basically everything
that I found myself frustrated by
in &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Its hybrid 3D artstyle
should render
depth-perception issues
a thing of the past.
Deep elemental combat returns
but with varied weapons
which have already proven
to have unique functions
in puzzle solving.
And the developers have promised
that the puzzle solving
will pull back on some
of the more controversial decisions
that made them divisive
without sacrificing any complexity.
Pull up a chair
and read the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.radicalfishgames.com&#x2F;?cat=17&quot;&gt;development blog posts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
I hope you find them
just as exciting as I do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; might never be recognized
alongside &lt;em&gt;Hollow Knight&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
as a big dog of indie gaming
like I think it should,
but if we get enough attention
on &lt;em&gt;Alabaster Dawn&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
it just might have a shot.
So there&#x27;s your call to action.
Buy &lt;em&gt;CrossCode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this game on a whim one day.
It looked interesting enough
and the pitch really grabbed my attention
so I put it on my wishlist.
About a year later,
I finally bought the game while it was on sale.
I went in with no clear idea of what to expect.
What I found was &lt;strong&gt;nothing less than a masterpiece&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
is a quirky turn-based JRPG
with a cartoony hand-drawn artstyle
and a unique sense of humor
where you control a cursed
three-piece rock band
who have the ability
to engage in musical battles
where they deal damage with their music.
And it rocks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the game genres out there,
it seems that the JRPG
is the subject of some of the most experimentation.
I think that in large part,
that&#x27;s because the traditional turn-based JRPG
just has &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of flaws.
People still make and play JRPGs,
but very few of them still have
all of the annoying elements
associated with the early days
of the genre.
Some measure of defiance, therefore,
is the norm
when creating in this space.
I also believe that,
due to the nature of the mechanics at play,
there are &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; ways
to put your own personal spin
on the JRPG formula;
in this way, it is
a uniquely spinnable space
to create in.
Think of how &lt;em&gt;Earthbound&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; sets itself apart
from its contemporaries mechanically
versus how &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; does
or how &lt;em&gt;Paper Mario&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; does.
I think what sets &lt;em&gt;Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
apart from its contemporaries
is that its creators came up with
ways to &lt;strong&gt;break RPG conventions
that no one else even thought of breaking&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To introduce this concept,
I&#x27;d like to start by discussing the battle system.
&lt;em&gt;Deathbulge&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has a &lt;strong&gt;turn-based battle system&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
with a strong &lt;strong&gt;active time element&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
(think &lt;em&gt;Chrono Trigger&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;).
Your fronted character
moves across a bar
and when they reach the end,
they can perform a move.
The uniqueness comes from the fact
that the bar is subdivided into four &quot;measures,&quot;
each of which can hold some kind of effect
that is applied to the fronted player
while the marker is in that measure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;dbbotb&#x2F;screenshot-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Measure effects in Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bar replaces many elements
of the traditional turn-based battle system
including status effects, summons, and more
(which I will not spoil
because I think it is best
to experience what else the bar does
on your own).
In the image above,
the flaming skull effect
is called &lt;strong&gt;PAIN&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
and is a stand-in
for burn, poison,
and any other automatic
life-loss status effect.
You can also see &lt;strong&gt;HASTE&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;,
which speeds your marker up
as it passes through those measures
and &lt;strong&gt;MAD PAIN&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
which is an upgraded form of Pain.
The purple one on the far right of the image
will remain a mystery.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mechanic is &lt;strong&gt;so cool&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;!
I&#x27;ve never truly engaged
with status effects that deeply before.
I think it&#x27;s because,
although I do understand that they&#x27;re there,
it&#x27;s hard to visualize what tangible benefit
it gives me to inflict status effects on enemies,
especially the more complex ones.
This game really hit for me
because finally I have a way
to understand &lt;em&gt;what&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; effects do
and exactly how helpful they are.
It adds an additional strategic element.
Fundamentally, it is
a kind of &lt;strong&gt;open-ended puzzle&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
that you play alongside
the main combat system.
It additionally adds some more dynamicity
since things are happening all the time,
including between turns.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The litle carat in the image
indicates where the next effects
will be applied.
In this case,
if the player were to make a move
that applied two measures of an effect
to their own bar,
it would override the Haste,
not the Pain,
which would obviously be preferable.
After looking at some others&#x27; reviews,
I noticed some people say
that it&#x27;s frustrating
that you can&#x27;t choose
which measures to apply effects to.
I couldn&#x27;t agree less!
Maneuvering around the temperamental bar
trying to override negative measure effects
and retain positive ones
is integral to the puzzle.
The most I would ask for
that I don&#x27;t believe the game provisions
is a beat or move
that allows you to skip measures,
applying no effect to them,
but even that is not necessary
as there are ways later on in the game
that can provide a comparable effect
that provides more utility anyway.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment I realized
that I was truly in for something else entirely
was when I got a tutorial
on how to use items.
That&#x27;s right, one element
where Deathbulge innovates
where I can&#x27;t think of any other game
that does so
is in its &lt;strong&gt;item system&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
I&#x27;d never thought of JRPG items
as something to be fixed.
In fact, I noticed while writing this paragraph
that the phrase &quot;item system&quot;
doesn&#x27;t even sound like something that&#x27;s real
because no one in the history of gaming
has ever said anything like
&quot;that game has a really interesting item system.&quot;
Yet this dev team once again proved
that I am stupid for &lt;em&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; talking
about item systems in games.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Deathbulge&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, you have a limited quantity of &quot;stock&quot;
which can be redeemed in various quantities for &quot;merch,&quot;
which provide different item effects.
For instance, a low-potency restorative item costs 1 stock,
while a higher-potency restorative item costs 2,
and a group-healing item costs 3.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;dbbotb&#x2F;merch.png&quot; alt=&quot;An early-game merch menu in Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system innovates in a few interesting ways,
adding onto what is usually a pretty rote system
in most other games that have consumable items,
not even just JRPGs.
First, it adds &lt;strong&gt;versatility&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:
once you have a certain piece of merch unlocked,
you can use it in any battle,
so long as you are willing to pay its stock cost.
It also adds &lt;strong&gt;balancing&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:
there is an issue that occurs in many other RPGs
where lesser healing items lose all relevance
once you reach the endgame
and have enough money that
you can just purchase a full inventory
of better-quality items.
No, every item use is an intentional choice here
with its own considerations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it does something truly grand:
it combats the ubiquitous analysis paralysis
among gamers that prevent us
from ever using our items.
There are no single-use merch items
and there are no ways that not using an item
in a particular fight would benefit you
in a fight further down the road.
The only thing it costs you
if you want to use an item
is money,
which is easily acquired.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large part of this game
is dependent on &lt;strong&gt;building your character&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
But, like, in a cool and innovative way.
Many games, including some that I quite like,
encourage you to pursue
a specialized build for your character,
but give you very little incentive to do so
as just randomly picking moves and stats
will get you to the end with no major hitches.
In &lt;em&gt;Deathbulge&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
this couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.
You have one &quot;beat&quot; slot that can be filled
from a shared pool of options,
three &quot;mod&quot; slots that contain moves
unique to your character,
and one (later two) &quot;patch&quot; slots
(again, pulling from a combined pool)
which provide passive benefits.
All told, that&#x27;s not too much space to work with,
meaning that there is &lt;strong&gt;no room for fluff&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
You have a lot of choices for each slot,
so find those synergies or die.
This is the first game that I&#x27;ve played
that has actually gotten me to spend time
theorycrafting potential combinations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;dbbotb&#x2F;gear.png&quot; alt=&quot;An early-game view of the gear menu in Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one major thing in battles
that doesn&#x27;t strictly adhere
to this philosophy
is items.
As mentioned previously,
you do have access
to a wide variety of merch items
by the end of the game,
which on paper seems like it could break
the careful balance of battles.
In practice, they do not
and probably cannot break the game
and in fact add even more interest
to the battle system.
Many of the good merch items
eat up sizeable chunks
of even the maximum final stock count.
In fact, stock is the only resource in a battle
that is &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; limited
since Hype (this game&#x27;s resource
that can be expended to perform moves,
like MP or SP in other games)
refills automatically
and health can be recovered.
Even new lives can be cheap
depending on your build and situation.
Every other advantage is gained
as you use your moves.
But if you want even &lt;em&gt;one&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; effect
that you didn&#x27;t intentionally build for,
you can technically have it,
but that&#x27;s coming out
of your only limited resource pool.
Tough luck.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point,
I&#x27;ll take a bit of a &lt;strong&gt;diversion&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
to talk about my own build a bit
because it&#x27;s illustrative
of one of my few problems with this game.
Feel free to skip this part.
Although I really loved
trying to come up with builds,
I stumbled onto something really effective
about halfway through the game
and as much as I wanted to experiment
with other kinds of builds,
it just kept working
and, in fact, the same build
just kept getting more effective
with the addition of more mods
that just made it even more effective.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
The core of the engine,
for those curious,
is as follows (contains spoilers):
&lt;&#x2F;summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make Faye a &lt;strong&gt;Show-Off&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
and give her heavy-hitting Melody moves
that apply effects to your own bar.
Make Ian a &lt;strong&gt;Headbanger&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
and give him heavy-hitting Noise moves
that apply effects to the opponent&#x27;s bar.
Give Briff &lt;strong&gt;restorative moves&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
that apply Soothe and its variants
and, crucially, &lt;strong&gt;Good Vibe Preservation&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
To set up a tough fight:
&lt;&#x2F;summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by filling your bar with effects,
Faye&#x27;s speed from the show-off class
often lets you get one or more of these in
before the enemy gets one turn.
Then, have Briff use Good Vibe Preservation.
At this point, you will be shielded
from the brunt of many attacks
both in terms of hit points and measure effects.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all members of the party
are able to use
whatever moves they want
without too much risk
as most enemies
are not equipped with moves
that can shred through
your now-protected measure effects.
I think I can count on one hand
the number of times
I came across an enemy that applies
more than two measure effects at once,
so in the course of normal battle
you should have plenty of warning
to run Good Vibe Preservation again.
Also, if you ever have a bad bar,
GVP can clear out the negative effects
and advance you to an unshielded effect
that you can safely write over
either with Faye or Briff.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play cautiously,
don&#x27;t let them touch your bar,
and if you ever lose a battle,
set up harder.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
At the end of the game, my loadout was:
&lt;&#x2F;summary&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faye&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Axe of Annihilation, Breezin&#x27;, and Dazzling Shred.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ian&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Zero Hertz, Mega Pop Slap, and Palm Destroyer.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Briff&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: GONG, Weaver of Darkness, and Good Vibe Preservation.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After writing this section,
I actually discovered something interesting:
a lot of the gear that I was using
was actually buffed in the 1.1.0 update.
So, uh, mission accomplished
with those buffs I guess.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked my loadout, and I felt powerful while using it
(up until the final boss, which really tested me)
but it left most party members with their &lt;strong&gt;default class&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
and I still ended up using quite a few mods
that I got at the beginning of the game,
so while I was did swap some out,
it didn&#x27;t feel like I was constantly innovating,
just switching to a better variant of the same strategy.
At one point I tried swapping some of my characters classes
while keeping the engine proper intact
to see if I could try something different,
but it just didn&#x27;t feel effective
and it would have taken a lot of experimenting
to get it to work, I think.
Furthermore, I know there were inefficiencies
even in my final loadout.
Some moves were quite rarely used
and some mods even got in the way more than they helped.
But I never &lt;em&gt;had&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to iron that out,
and it started to feel just a bit cheap
later on in the game.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
One slightly spoilery note
about balancing in the endgame:
&lt;&#x2F;summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did appreciate, though,
how the level counter is capped at 20.
At one point I was starting to get concerned
that I was going to find myself overleveled
and that I would end up
just ripping through the final boss
without feeling that I&#x27;d earned it.
But the level cap
is intelligently placed
such that for the final fights in the game,
you can&#x27;t just level past them.
You have to get good enough
at the actual mechanics of the game
and create a good loadout
if you want to reach the end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversion over.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow I&#x27;ve gotten this far
without even mentioning the art in this game.
This game has a stupid amount of art and animation.
I swear, almost every cutscene in this game
has at least one character animation or dialogue portrait
that I had never seen before.
I was blown away
by just how expressive these characters are.
In battle, many moves have their own unique animations
that don&#x27;t play anywhere else.
And, as mentioned, there is no shortage of moves.
Also, all of the main characters
have different class-based appearances
which affect their sprites
in the overworld and in battle
as well as in their numerous dialogue expressions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&#x27;s not just the characters.
Some of my favorite animations in this game
are in the combat elements.
The measure effects aren&#x27;t static images.
They have detailed animations when they appear
and they move and sway in oddly satisfying ways
while they sit in the bar,
helping to provide a clear visual language
during the otherwise very stimulating battles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game&#x27;s principle artist
is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bsky.app&#x2F;profile&#x2F;deathbulge.bsky.social&quot;&gt;Dan Martin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
who runs a webcomic
(also called &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deathbulge.com&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathbulge&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).
This comic originated
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deathbulge.com&#x2F;comics&#x2F;343&quot;&gt;several&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deathbulge.com&#x2F;comics&#x2F;384&quot;&gt;memes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
that you&#x27;ve probably seen around.
He also apparently
created &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;deathbulge&#x2F;status&#x2F;1075764020072697857&quot;&gt;this image&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
if that is worth anything to you.
If you go back to the comic
after finishing the game
or if you were familiar with the comic
and played the game,
you would notice some shared characters
and even a few familiar bits.
By Dan&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deathbulge.com&#x2F;comics&#x2F;435&quot;&gt;own admission&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
he spent every day
for most of a decade
working on the game.
I am no artist,
but I can recognize effort
when I see it.
The game is a cartoony visual feast,
manic and exaggerated
in just the right way
to complement the game&#x27;s
off-the-wall sense of humor.
This game wouldn&#x27;t have hit &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the same
if there hadn&#x27;t been such a clear emphasis
on the aesthetic
(although if there were even half as many
unique dialogue portraits in this game,
it would have still been more expressive
than even most other story-based games
that I have played in the past).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That all being said,
I just didn&#x27;t really vibe with the story,
at least at the start.
Like many video game stories,
things start lower-stakes
and gradually the intensity ramps up.
I was frustrated by the fact
that the first few chapters
were completely unrelated
to the Battle of the Bands.
Even though plot elements from them
do come back later
and are instrumental in wrapping up the game,
they felt so irrelevant at the time
and I still don&#x27;t think
that it was that great of a start
to the game.
I&#x27;m glad that the gameplay,
the humor,
the characters,
and the worldbuilding
kept me going until the story
really started to pick up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had high expectations for the
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deathbulge.bandcamp.com&#x2F;album&#x2F;deathbulge-battle-of-the-bands-ost&quot;&gt;soundtrack&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
given the entire theming of the game
and whoops, we hit peak again.
There&#x27;s over two hours of music in this game
created by the two composers,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;lesliewai&quot;&gt;Leslie Wai&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;discobible.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Patrick Henaghen&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
There is no lack of variety here.
A large amount of the music in this game
is instrumental rock,
given that that is the style
that the main characters play.
But certain other bands
introduce different genres
including heavy metal, synth pop,
jazz fusion, smooth jazz,
and a lot of funk.
I urge you to give it a listen.
There&#x27;s a lot to keep you occupied.
And a lot of these songs
are rather substantial.
I&#x27;m used to fairly short loops
in video game music
but the composers for this game
have given us a bunch of
multiple-minute tracks
that make even walking around in the world
feel interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while I&#x27;m individually thanking
every member of the team,
I might as well get everyone.

handled the technical aspects
of game development
for &lt;em&gt;Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
This game is extremely smooth
and polished to a sheen
to the point of being almost frictionless
and that would not have been possible
without the diligent work
of these two members of the team.
Also, I need to show this
because it is genuinely one of the coolest things
that a game developer has ever done.

to thank the team for their work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My save file,
which finished up at 75% completion,
is at 15 hours,
give or take.
I would say that 100% completion
would probably take
about 20 hours.
By that metric,
this is a compact game,
by JRPG standards at least.
I think in some ways
the length is actually ideal.
The game does a good job
of not overstaying its welcome.
If the game were &lt;em&gt;too&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; much longer,
it would probably start
to feel repetitious
and its humor might start to grate,
so I&#x27;m glad that the devs
decided to cap it off here.
At the same time,
a part of me is screaming
that I just want to play eight more chapters
of the same exact same game.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
has no right being as obscure as it is.
Only 500 reviews? Are you kidding me?
This game is an innovative modern classic
and should be recognized as such.
I want to see swaths of games come out
that are inspired by this one
if only because
I need more of this game.
There is replay value here.
I would like to return to this game
in a year or so
and force myself to enjoy
some alternative strategies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game gets a &lt;strong&gt;hearty recommendation&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
I think more people should be aware of it,
which is why I&#x27;m in the process of telling
all of my friends to play it.
If even one part of this appeals to you,
I&#x27;d encourage you to give it a try
as even one
of the previously discussed talking points
would be enough to merit a purchase,
especially if it&#x27;s on sale.
To wrap up, though,
I would just like to mention that,
while I loved the fact
that every part of the game
from the combat to items to teambuilding
was all a fun open-ended puzzle,
that might not vibe with you.
Maybe skip this one
if you want an RPG
where you can just blast through enemies.
But if that particular descriptor
does not apply to you,
there&#x27;s no reason not to give this one a try.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
