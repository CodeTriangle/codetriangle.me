          <title>The Importance of Keeping Hackathons by Nerds for Nerds</title>

          <description xml:base="https://codetriangle.me/blog/2025-02-28-hackathons-by-the-nerds/">&lt;p&gt;Today, I will be attending a hackathon.
I look forward to this time every year
because I love this hackathon.
I get to spend a lot of time
with my friends
and I have an excuse to work on something new.
Plus, there&#x27;s always a lot of good food to eat.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I should be excited about it for more than that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, this particular hackathon
has recently been co-opted by
the College of Business at my university.
Since that has happened,
the entire event is just a little sadder
every time it comes around.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing,
the categories have gotten far dumber.
Three years ago,
in 2022,
there was a fairly standard grouping of categories
including Hardware, Data Analytics, and Game Dev.
It wasn&#x27;t a perfect affair —
the Health and Fitness category
was poorly attended
and had to be merged with the General category for scoring
and was removed the next year —
but at least every category made sense.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, a &quot;business solutions&quot; category was introduced
where &quot;no technical experience&quot; was required.
This was a strange addition
to the standard five, but
I understand the intention of this
was to make the hackathon more inclusive,
and I do support that goal.
I will also say that a 24-hour event
to come up with business ideas
is not &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; without merit,
but I also contend that it&#x27;s not a hackathon anymore.
It&#x27;s a separate event
that targets a separate group
and only encourages a toxic mindset
which is prevalent in the minds
of many business majors
where they just need to come up with An Idea™,
find a programmer to make it for them,
and reap all the money from the whole affair.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the categories are all over the place.
Cybersecurity, Game Dev, Hardware, and AI&#x2F;ML are familiar.
But the Data Analytics category
has seemingly been split into two:
&quot;Datathon&quot; and &quot;Sports Analytics&quot;,
the latter likely only existing
because of a sponsorship from the University athletics department.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business solutions category is gone this year.
In its place is &quot;Hack the Planet&quot; —
but good luck finding anyone
who could explain what that entails
because the explanations of these categories
have been given less detail than ever before,
devolving into little more than word salad.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackathon categories exist to inspire further creativity,
but these new categories do little to help with that,
in no small part
because participants need to understand
what kinds of submissions will be accepted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has also been
a greater emphasis on networking with companies
over the past few years.
Networking has always been a part of hackathons,
but if it overtakes the creative aspect,
it becomes a job fair.
Again, not a meritless concept,
but it&#x27;s not a hackathon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s also the matter of the entrance fee,
which I understand the existence of
as a way to ensure that people
don&#x27;t sign up and then fail to show up.
But the fee gets more expensive every year
despite the event receiving even more sponsorships each year.
It&#x27;s possible that this is a necessary evil
to keep the hackathon going,
but nothing about the event feels like it has become
substantially more expensive each year.
In my opinion,
it feels like nothing more than a transparent attempt
to scrape even more money
from an event that isn&#x27;t in danger
of going away.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this feeds back
to the fact that the event
is run by business majors,
people who don&#x27;t understand
why programmers like to attend hackathons
in the first place.
It is yet another facet
of the life of a programmer
where we are expected to go to work
and create for the benefit
of someone who does not understand us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is
that most programmers and engineers
will be working for people
who focus on business for most of their professional lives.
Hackathons, game jams, and other gatherings like them
are supposed to be a clean break from &quot;the industry&quot;
where your tasks are mandated by someone
who wants to use you as a vehicle to make money.
Instead, for a little while,
you can manage yourself
and just make a project that you care about.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, there&#x27;s nothing preventing you
from still treating it like an opportunity
to just hang out with friends
and eat high-calorie food
and get minimal sleep
and make something interesting only to you.
The underlying attitude behind the event may have changed,
but it need not change your attitude toward it.
You don&#x27;t have to play the game
where you make something
that neatly fits into one of their categories
and would impress a business major
all to get a prize.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that&#x27;s not a remedy.
The event would obviously be a better experience
and much more reasonably run
if it were still under the control of those
who are in its target demographic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely too late for this hackathon.
I expect it will simply get worse year over year
due to the ongoing meddling.
Which is why I now beseech you,
dear reader,
if you are in a position of control
over a local hackathon or similar event,
keep control in the hands of the nerds.
Don&#x27;t let your hackathon become
just another way for the people
who already control the lives of many programmers
to exert even more control over them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>My Quest to Supplant RMS</title>
          <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>

          <guid>https://codetriangle.me/blog/2025-01-31-supplanting-rms/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://codetriangle.me/blog/2025-01-31-supplanting-rms/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;rms-richard-matthew-stallman&quot;&gt;RMS (Richard Matthew Stallman)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letters &quot;RMS&quot; will be very familiar
to anyone who has so much as glimpsed into
the FOSS community.
For many people,
Richard Matthew Stallman
may indeed be the first person that they learn of
in the entire space.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His free software absolutism is funny.
The &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stallman.org&#x2F;stallman-computing.html&quot;&gt;lengths to which he will bend&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
so that he doesn&#x27;t have
a single line of blasphemous nonfree code
running on any machine he&#x27;s used
in the past ten years
are objectively hilarious.
At the same time,
because of how ardent he is in this,
it is easy to view this
as a kind of purity
to which us mortals could only aspire
because we enjoy getting things done.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman is a spectacle.
He has done a lot
for the free software movement
and I firmly believe that we would be
in a much worse place without his contributions.
He is to be commended for that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commended, but not venerated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, RMS is a figure
who can&#x27;t seem to escape controversy.
Underneath the natural fascination
with these kinds of quacks,
it&#x27;s easy to forget that the people themselves
can actually be pretty crummy.
Stallman fits into this category.
Read &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drewdevault.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;25&#x2F;2023-11-26-RMS-on-sex.html&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stallman-report.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;this article&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
(&lt;strong&gt;extreme content warning for both&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;)
to learn a bit more
about Stallman the man.
It doesn&#x27;t matter which; they cover similar points.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don&#x27;t just want to complain
about a person I find to be a thorn in the side
of the free software community.
I&#x27;m offering a solution of my own, you see.
Others have petitioned the FSF
to boot him out of leadership &lt;em&gt;again&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
to no avail.
My solution
is to become the new RMS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rms-richard-michael-snider&quot;&gt;RMS (Richard Michael Snider)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first name, Richard, is the same as Stallman&#x27;s.
Additionally, all three of my initials
are the same as his initials.
Simply put,
I want to become the Richard that people think of
when they say RMS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify: I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; want
to replace him as the leader of the FSF.
My goal is simply to supplant him
as the owner
of the initialism RMS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this a plausible goal?
Of course not.
Is it funny to pretend that I actually want to try?
It sure is!
So here we go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plan&quot;&gt;The Plan&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is simple:
I must make myself the subject of mass fascination
within the FOSS space
to the extent that Stallman&#x27;s name
is forgotten to time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan will be split into two parts.
First, I will make some commitments to you,
dear reader.
Second, I will ask you
to help me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-part&quot;&gt;My Part&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already have a website
which is clandestine in appearance
and which exists almost exclusively
to hold the canonical versions
of my opinions.
I will be writing posts on this blog
every month of this year.
With enough eyes here,
I will develop a following of people
who are endeared to me
on account of my silly anecdotes
and highly specific opinions on tech.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the functional purpose
of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stallman.org&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stallman.org&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; these days,
so I consider this to be vital
to my plan.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point where this diverges
from Stallman&#x27;s approach
is that I will not say
anything terrible or heinous
that will make everyone hate me.
Nope, just good old silly tech takes
from this RMS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also be modifying the language
on this site
to explicitly emphasize
that I am RMS (but not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; RMS).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-part&quot;&gt;Your Part&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your part is simple:
spread the knowledge
that there is a new RMS in town
and that he&#x27;s someone
you can feel good about liking.
Link this blog everywhere.
Make sure people know
that I am coming
for Stallman&#x27;s title of RMS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I wouldn&#x27;t be a true RMS
without a copypasta of my own.
Whenever someone is acting
excessively Stallman-esque,
post the following:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Stallman&#x27;s achievements
and leadership of the GNU project
and the Free Software Foundation
have done an impressive amount
for the world of open source
and those achievements should be recognized.
He has serious issues, however,
and should not be seen as incorruptible,
which is a common sentiment in many newer entrants
into the Free Software movement.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do believe that opinionated and uncompromising people
are necessary to push the FOSS community even further;
however, people who are rude, provocative, and insulting
to other members of the FOSS community --
people that ought to be allies instead of enemies --
are dangerous and have more potential
to cause harm than good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then if you plugged my blog at the end
that would also be nice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
