        <content type="html" xml:base="https://codetriangle.me/projects/2024-10-06-ssh-cheatsheet/">&lt;p&gt;Many years ago,
I gave a presentation
for the Free Software and Linux Club
at Utah State University
teaching people how to use SSH.
Specifically, I chose to emphasize
the use of the OpenSSH client.
I truly believe that SSH
and, in particular OpenSSH,
is one of the most powerful tools
available to you
as a computer user
(not just as a Linux user).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I had been using SSH
for several years,
but I had had a rough start with the tool
and it took me a good while
to learn all of its secrets
and how to use it well.
I saw the presentation
as a great opportunity
to give new users
the opportunity to learn in just over an hour
what had taken me many years to figure out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to make a little handout
to go along with the presentation,
to ease the audience into the concepts
and to give them as reminders
in case they forgot the syntax.
However, I also ended up receiving feedback
from seasoned users
who ended up referencing my cheatsheet
for some of the more obscure features.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the years have gone by,
the presentation has gotten even longer
as I&#x27;ve learned more about SSH myself.
This year,
I decided to redesign my handout
in Inkscape
(the previous version was just a LaTeX document).
I am extremely proud of how it turned out
so I decided to share it here.
I hope it is relevant and useful
for years to come.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A printable PDF version is also available
with two copies side-by-side
on a piece of letter paper.
&lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;documents&#x2F;ssh-cheatsheet-two.pdf&quot;&gt;You can find it here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have decided to distribute this
under Creative Commons 4.0 BY,
the least restrictive one.
The cheatsheet&#x27;s source
and distributions
are available
at the following GitHub repo:
